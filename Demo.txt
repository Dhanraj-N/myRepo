With *ngFor, the <div> repeats for each product in the list.

Structural directives shape or reshape the DOM's structure, by adding, removing, and manipulating elements.
 For more information about structural directives, see Structural directives.
 Currently, the product list displays the name and description of each product. 
 The ProductListComponent also defines a products property that contains imported data
  for each product from the products array in products.ts.
The next step is to create a new alert feature that will use product data from the 
ProductListComponent. The alert should check the product's price. If it is found to 
be greater than $700, a Notify Me button should be displayed. When a user clicks on the button,
 they should be able to sign up for notifications that will inform them when the product goes on sale.

This section walks you through creating a child component, ProductAlertsComponent, 
that can receive data from its parent component, ProductListComponent.
