Welcome to Angular!

This tutorial introduces you to the essentials of Angular by walking you through building an e-commerce 
site with a catalog, shopping cart, and check-out form.

To help you get started right away, this tutorial uses a ready-made application that you can examine
 and modify interactively on StackBlitz â€”without having to set up a local work environment.
 StackBlitz is a browser-based development environment where you can create, save, and share projects using a variety of technologies.
 The project section on the left shows the source files that make up the application, including the infrastructure and configuration files.

When you generate the StackBlitz example applications that accompany the tutorials, StackBlitz creates the starter files and mock 
data for you. The files you use throughout the tutorial are in the src folder.
